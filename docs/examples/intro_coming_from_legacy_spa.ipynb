      "# Transitioning to `nengo_spa` coming from the core Nengo legacy SPA implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "This tutorial is intended for persons who are already familiar with the legacy Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) implementation that was shipped with core Nengo until at least version 2.7. Thus, it will not explain any of the background behind the SPA and will reference concepts used in the legacy implementation. If you are completely new to the SPA, you might want to start with [this tutorial that assumes no knowledge of the legacy SPA implementation](intro.ipynb).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why switch to `nengo_spa`?\n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder why you should switch to `nengo_spa`, if you have been using the legacy SPA and it was working well for you. Here is a number of reasons to prefer `nengo_spa`:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Support for action rules of arbitrary complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "A rule as complex as `dot((role * filler + BiasVector) * tag, cmp) >> ...`, which includes two circular convolutions and a dot product of two non-fixed values, is possible with nengo_spa. This was not possible with the legacy SPA implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### \u201cType safety\u201d in action rules\n",
      "\n",
      "If different vocabularies are combined an explicit conversion is required. This prevents hard-to-track-down bugs. This conversion is also explicit about *how* the conversion is done, instead of just applying a fixed method that is not always appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### The neural representations optimized for better accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "That means less neurons are needed to achieve the same performance. This can make simulations run faster. This improvement of accuracy is comparable to the results presented in [\u201cOptimizing Semantic Pointer Representations for Symbol-Like Processing in Spiking Neural Networks\u201d](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149928) which achieved improvements of up to 25 times. In contrast to that paper, the implementation used in `nengo_spa` is purely based on setting appropriate radii and distributions for evaluation points as well as intercepts. This implementation is much faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "### New Python-based syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "A new Python-based syntax gives syntax highlighting and can make use of static checking tools like pylint to catch misspelled names and similar errors early.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other features\n",
      "\n",
      "* The neural representation has been optimized to allow the representation of the identity vector (with the option to turn this optimization off).\n",
      "* SPA networks can be used as and within normal Nengo networks. For example, instead of a basic and an SPA associative memory network, there is only one type of network that can be used in either case.\n",
      "* SPA networks can be nested.\n",
      "* Support for the Nengo config system.\n",
      "* Scalars can now be routed and used as inputs/outputs using `spa.Scalar`.\n",
      "* Lots of fixed issues and in general less possibilities to do things wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Importing nengo_spa\n",
      "\n",
      "To save typing it is recommended to `import nengo_spa as spa`. Note that this is only a very small difference to `import nengo.spa as spa` which imports the legacy SPA. In the following, it is assumed that you imported `nengo_spa` as `spa`."

      "\n",

There isn't any downside to using `spa.Network()` and in this way you will not run into problems of using `nengo.Network()` where `spa.Network()` is required. That being said, if you have existing `nengo.Network`s (that do not use any SPA features), these can stay `nengo.Network`s. In other words, you will only have to touch code using the SPA to upgrade to nengo_spa; networks not using the SPA system may stay as they are.\n",

Each `>>` means, take the left side and route it to the input an the right side. (Previously this was done with the assignment operator `=` and the other way around.) When accessing specific inputs of a module, standard dot notation is used (instead of an underscore). Also note that the names of some of the inputs have changed. They follow a consistent naming scheme now: always starting with `input_` and you use the same name in action rules as in manually created Nengo connections. Because everything is stated in pure Python code now, you have to be explicit about when you are using a symbolic reference to a semantic pointer. That is done with the `spa.sym.` prefix.
