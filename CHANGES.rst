1.0.0 (December 12, 2019)
=========================

**Changed**

- Ensure compatibility with Nengo 3.
  (`#225 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/225>`__,
  `#233 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/233>`__,
  `#236 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/236>`__)
- Modules and networks no longer set a default label. This will give
  more useful labels by default in Nengo GUI (assuming the latest dev
  version).
  (`#234 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/234>`__,
  `#235 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/235>`__)
- All networks have been converted to classes. This will give
  more useful labels by default in Nengo GUI (assuming the latest dev
  version).
  (`#234 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/234>`__,
  `#235 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/235>`__)

0.6.2 (June 21, 2019)
=====================

**Added**

- Add previously missing documentation on the ``vector_generation`` module as
  well as the ``reinterpret`` and ``translate`` methods of ``SemanticPointer``.
  (`#228 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/228>`__,
  `#229 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/229>`__)

  `#231 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/231>`__)

  `#218 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/218>`__)


0.6.0 (September 17, 2018)
==========================

**Added**

- Support for algebras that allow to use binding operations other than circular
  convolution. This includes an implementation of vector-derived transformation
  binding (VTB) and the ``nengo_spa.networks.VTB`` network to perform this
  particular binding operation.
  (`#69 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/69>`__,
  `#198 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/198>`__)
- Added generators for vectors with different properties that can be used to
  define how vectors are created in a vocabulary (e.g., axis-aligned,
  orthogonal, unitary).
  (`#201 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/201>`_,
  `#129 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/129>`_)
- Added a matrix multiplication network ``nengo_spa.networks.MatrixMult`` based
  on the nengo-extras implementation.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/198>`__)
- Allow to connect to the utility node returned by `ifmax` with the SPA `>>`
  operator.
  (`#190 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/190>`_,
  `#194 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/194>`_)
- The Semantic Pointer names *AbsorbingElement*, *Identity*, and *Zero* now
  have a special meaning in *Vocabulary* and *nengo_spa.sym* and will return
  the respective special Semantic Pointers.
  (`#195 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/195>`_,
  `#176 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/176>`_)
- *SemanticPointer* instance can now track names for improved labeling in Nengo
  GUI.
  (`#202 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/202>`_,
  `#184 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/184>`_)
- Label the utility nodes for the action selection.
  (`#202 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/202>`__)


**Changed**

- A number of module names have been changed for better naming consistency.
  In particular,

  - ``nengo_spa.actions`` to ``nengo_spa.action_selection``,
  - ``nengo_spa.pointer`` to ``nengo_spa.semantic_pointer``,
  - ``nengo_spa.vocab`` to ``nengo_spa.vocabulary``,
  - and ``nengo_spa.modules.assoc_mem`` to
    ``nengo_spa.modules.associative_memory``.

  (`#199 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/199>`_,
  `#205 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/205>`_)
- Require the ``mapping`` argument for associative memories. In addition to
  dictionaries and the string ``'by-key'``, a sequence of strings can be passed
  in to create an auto-associative memory.
  (`#177 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/177>`_)
- Changed the ``rng`` argument for ``Vocabulary`` to ``pointer_gen``.
  (`#201 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/201>`_)
- Renamed ``input_a`` and ``input_b`` of the ``nengo_spa.Bind`` module to
  ``input_left`` and ``input_right`` to account for non-commutative binding
  methods where the order of operands matters. Also, renamed the ``invert_a``
  and ``invert_b`` arguments to ``unbind_left`` and ``unbind_right`` to reflect
  that some binding methods might not have inverse vectors, but might still be
  able to do unbinding.
  (`#69 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/69>`__,
  `#198 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/198>`__)
- Renamed the ``nengo_spa.State`` parameter ``represent_identity`` to
  ``represent_cc_identity`` to reflect that it only optimizes for the circular
  convolution identity, but not the identity for other binding operations.
  (`#212 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/212>`_)


**Removed**

- Removed ``nengo_spa.networks.circularconvolution.circconv`` because
  ``nengo_spa.algebras.CircularConvolutionAlgebra`` provides the same
  functionality.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/198>`__)
- The ``SemanticPointer`` class does no longer accept a single integer as
  dimensionality to create a random vector. Use the new generators in
  ``nengo_spa.vector_generation`` instead.
  (`#201 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/201>`_)


**Fixed**

- Raise an exception instead of returning incorrect results from
  ``prob_cleanup``. Also, fix the function's incorrect documentation.
  (`#203 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/203>`__,
  `#206 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/206>`__)
- Fix ``nengo_spa.ActionSelection.keys()`` when no named actions have been
  provided.
  (`#210 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/210>`_)
- Do not create an unnecessary compare network when computing a dot product
  with a ``SemanticPointer`` instance.
  (`#202 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/202>`__)
- Handle ``SemanticPointer`` instances correctly as first argument to
  ``nengo_spa.dot``.
  (`#202 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/202>`__)


0.5.2 (July 6, 2018)
====================

**Fixed**

- SPA modules will use the same default vocabularies even if not instantiated
  in the context of a `spa.Network`.
  (`#174 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-spa/issues/174>`_,
  `#185 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-spa/pull/185>`_)
- Disallow Python keywords, including None, True, and False, as well as unicode
  characters from Python names.
  (`#188 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/188>`_,

  (`#189 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/189>`_,
  `#191 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/191>`_)
- Raise exception when using NumPy arrays in SPA operations which would give
  unexpected results.
  (`#192 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/192>`_,
  `#193 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/193>`_)

0.1.1 (May 19, 2017)
====================

**Fixed**

- Updated the 0.1 changelog.


0.1 (May 19, 2017)
==================

Initial release of Nengo SPA with core functionality, but excluding

- updates and completion the documentation,
- proper integration with Nengo GUI.

The API is still conisdered unstable in some parts of it are likely to change
in the future.

Main features compared to the SPA implementation shipped with Nengo are:

- neural representations have been optimized for higher accuracy,
- support for arbitrarily complex action rules,
- SPA networks can be used as normal Nengo networks,
- and SPA networks can be nested.
