0.3.0 (October 16, 2017)
========================

**Added**

- Add ``add_output`` and ``add_neuron_output`` methods to
  ``IdentityEnsembleArray`` to provide the full API that is provided by the
  regular Nengo ``EnsembleArray``.
  (`#61 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/61>`_,

  `#26 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/26>`_)
- Add a ``solver`` argument to the action rule's ``translate`` to use a solver
  instead of an outer product to obtain the transformation matrix which can
  give slightly better results.
  (`#62 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/62>`_,
  `#57 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/57>`_)

**Changed**

- Actions rules do not require module to be assigned to the model any longer.
  They will access exactly the same variables as are available in the
  surrounding Python code. This means that existing action rules need to be
  changed to reference the correct names.
  (`#63 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/63>`_)
- The action rule syntax changed significantly.
  (`#54 <https://github.com/nengo_spa/nengo/issues/54>`_,

- Actions will be build automatically without an explicit call to ``build()``.
  (`#59 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/59>`_,
  `#45 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/45>`_,
  `#55 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/55>`_)
- Consolidated the functionality of ``Encode`` and ``Decode`` into
  ``Transcode``.
  (`#67 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/67>`_,
  `#58 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/58>`_)

**Fixed**

  odd initial dimensionality.

  when actually required.
  (`#60 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/60>`_,
  `#42 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/42>`_)

  target vocabulary when ``populate=False``.
  (`#62 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/pull/62>`_,
  `#56 <https://github.com/nengo/nengo_spa/issues/56>`_)

0.1.1 (May 19, 2017)
====================

**Fixed**

- Updated the 0.1 changelog.


0.1 (May 19, 2017)
==================

Initial release of Nengo SPA with core functionality, but excluding

- updates and completion the documentation,
- proper integration with Nengo GUI.

The API is still conisdered unstable in some parts of it are likely to change
in the future.

Main features compared to the SPA implementation shipped with Nengo are:

- neural representations have been optimized for higher accuracy,
- support for arbitrarily complex action rules,
- SPA networks can be used as normal Nengo networks,
- and SPA networks can be nested.
